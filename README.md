# CP_DEM
Cross-Property DEM Toolbox. Written by Phil Cilli, 6 February 2021.

## Description

> A set of MATLAB scripts and functions which model a composite or porous material's elastic properties from its electrical properties, and vice versa, using the model of Cilli and Chapman (2021) [DOI:10.1093/gji/ggab046]. See "ReleaseNotes_CP_DEM.pdf" in the main branch for further details.
## Installation

> Add all scripts and functions into MATLAB filepath.
## Requirements

> The scripts and functions run on MATLAB. They are known to work on MATLAB 2019b at the time of writing this. They have not been tested on Octave.
## Support

> Please feel free to raise issues, discussion points, or suggestions for new features on the author's github profile - username: pcilli - or by email (found on the author's website).
